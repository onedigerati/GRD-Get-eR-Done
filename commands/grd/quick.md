<objective>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GRD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking) while skipping optional agents (research, plan-checker, verifier).

Quick mode is the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns grd-planner (quick mode) + grd-executor(s)
- Skips grd-phase-researcher, grd-plan-checker, grd-verifier
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table (NOT ROADMAP.md)

Use when: You know exactly what to do and the task is small enough to not need research or verification.

<process>
Execute the quick workflow from @~/.claude/get-er-done/workflows/quick.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, task description, planning, execution, state updates, commits).
